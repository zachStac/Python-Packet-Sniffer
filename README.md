# Python-Packet-Sniffer
build a set of programs that can be used on Linux and Windows systems. The program will be able to grab and examine packets. There will need to be a command line and a GUI interface that will allow the user to select the port or a list of ports. This project will also be needed for my IDS/ IPS project in the future, along with a UTM device build.
