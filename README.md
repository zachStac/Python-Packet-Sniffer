# Python-Packet-Sniffer

Goal: build a set of programs that can be used on Linux and Windows systems. The program will be able to grab and examine packets. There will need to be a command line and a GUI interface that will allow the user to select the port or a list of ports. This project will also be needed for my IDS/ IPS project in the future, along with a UTM device build.  

To Do:  
	Build a simple system to capture packets for Linux 
	Build a simple system to capture packets for Windows 
	Build a system to un-pack the packets and analyze the packet for both systems
	Build a CMD interface 
	Build a GUI interface this is mostly for windows, due to the fact most of my Linux interactions are all in the command line 
	
Project: 
•	I have attended a small snippet of code for grabbing packets on Linux
